Trying to make a basic Vampire Survivors clone. 

Trying to mimic what I've already managed with Unreal Engine earlier this year, after having created 

- enemies spawning randomly within a certain distance of the camera edge, and not out of the map.
- weapon pickups
- weapon projectiles and weapon firing types
- level up dialog with exp accumulation
- tilemap defining map boundaries or equivalent method
